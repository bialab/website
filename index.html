      <i><p><strong>About Me. . .</strong></p></i>
        <p>Take a look around my website; made by yours truly. This page is mostly an 'About Me'. Lets see . . . I was born and raised in
          Naples, FL. I attended Lake Park Elementary, Gulfview Middle, and Naples High School. I was enrolled in honors/AICE classes. 
          I ran cross-country and track. I played for my schools orchestra; I played the violin (but I also play guitar and piano). I volunteered for math teachers in Naples 
          High, and I also volunteered for NCH hospital one summer.Other volunteering oppurtunies took place with clubs that I was involved
          in, such as C.O.R.E club and F.F.E.A. Core was to spread awareness of drugs and alcohol abuse. FFEA was future educators helping
          their community. When I'm not at work or at school, I enjoy spending my free time working out, kickboxing and yoga, or taking pictures, scenery and my dog (see'gallery' tab). I am currently atttending FGCU where I am pursuing a math major. </p>
