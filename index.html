      <i><p><strong>About Me. . .</strong></p></i>
        <p>Take a look around my website; made by yours truly. This page is mostly an 'About Me'. Lets see . . . I was born and raised in
          Naples, FL. I attended Lake Park Elementary, Gulfview Middle, and Naples High School. I was enrolled in honors/AICE classes. 
          I ran cross-country and track. I played for my schools orchestra; I played the violin (but I also play guitar and piano). I volunteered for math teachers in Naples 
          High, and I also volunteered for NCH hospital one summer.Other volunteering oppurtunies took place with clubs that I was involved
          in, such as C.O.R.E club and F.F.E.A. Core was to spread awareness of drugs and alchol abuse. FFEA was to help future educators help 
          their community. I am currently atttending FGCU where I am pursuing a math major. </p>
       <p><i>P.S the pictures of the slideshow were taken by me. I am an amateur photographer (not really). I will like to thank my Samsung Galaxy S7 for the picture clairty.</i> </p>
